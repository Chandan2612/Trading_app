            <h2>Candlestick Chart</h2>
            <p>Candlestick charts are a crucial tool for traders to analyze price action. Each candlestick represents a specific time period and provides four key pieces of information: open, high, low, and close prices. The color and shape of the candlestick help traders understand market trends and momentum.</p>
            <p>Bullish (green or white) candlesticks indicate rising prices, while bearish (red or black) candlesticks signify falling prices. Patterns such as doji, engulfing, and hammer formations help traders predict future price movements.</p>
            <p>By combining candlestick charts with technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands, traders can make informed decisions and manage risks effectively.</p>
